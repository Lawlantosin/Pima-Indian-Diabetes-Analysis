### Pima Indian Diabetes Analysis

We will use logistic regression to model the "Pima Indians Diabetes" data set. This model will predict which people are likely to develop diabetes.


This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
